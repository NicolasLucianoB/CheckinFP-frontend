# checkin-frontend - Volunteer Check-in System

**CheckinFP** is a web application designed to streamline the check-in process for volunteers at events using **QR codes** for authentication and attendance tracking. The platform is built with **Next.js** and leverages **JWT** for secure authentication and session management.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: React-based framework for building the application with SSR (Server Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation).
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for better tooling and reliability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for building modern, responsive UIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
- **React Context API**: For managing global state, particularly user authentication status.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform optimized for Next.js applications.

## 🛠 Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicolasLucianoB/CheckinFP-frontend.git
cd CheckinFP-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `checkin-frontend` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd checkin-frontend
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the `checkin-frontend` directory to set up necessary environment variables. Example:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=<seu-backend>
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

Make sure to replace the values with your actual backend URL and JWT secret as needed.

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Now, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

### 5. Build and Start for Production

To create a production build and start the server:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

This will build the optimized production version and start the Next.js server.

## 🧑‍💻 Running the Application

After following the installation steps, you can start the application by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server. The app will be accessible at:

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: `<your-frontend>`
- **Backend (Go)**: `<your-backend>`

### 📝 Default Pages

- **Home**: A dashboard displaying volunteer data, attendance stats, and a check-in button.
- **Check-in**: Volunteers scan QR codes (generated by admin) that automatically register their attendance with token authentication.
- **Login**: Secure login page for user authentication.
- **Signup**: New users can register themselves to use the platform.

## 🧑‍🔧 Project Structure

Here's the general structure of the project:

```
CheckinFP/
├── checkin-frontend/             # Frontend (Next.js)
│   ├── app/                      # Pages and routing for the app (Next.js 13+ App Router)
│   ├── components/               # Reusable components (buttons, modals, etc.)
│   ├── public/                   # Static files (images, fonts, etc.) served at root
│   └── styles/                   # Tailwind CSS configurations and custom styles
└── checkin-backend/              # Backend (Go)
    ├── controllers/              # API controllers for handling requests
    ├── middlewares/              # Middleware (authentication, authorization)
    ├── models/                   # Database models and ORM configuration
    └── main.go                   # Main entry point for the Go server
```

*Comments*: The `app` directory uses Next.js 13's App Router for improved routing and layouts. The `public` folder contains assets accessible publicly. Backend folders organize logic for easy maintenance.

## 🔐 Authentication

The authentication system is based on **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. When logging in, users receive a token that must be included in subsequent requests to access protected routes, such as the check-in page.

1. **Login**: Users authenticate with their credentials, and the backend returns a JWT token.
2. **Token Validation**: The frontend validates the token via a secure `/me` route, and the user context is updated accordingly.

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally and in Production

- For local testing, ensure your backend is running and `.env.local` is properly configured.
- Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test API endpoints.
- When deploying, verify environment variables are set in your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel's dashboard).
- Monitor logs and errors via Vercel and backend hosting services for smooth production runs.

## 📦 Deployment

The frontend is hosted on **Vercel**, providing optimized deployment for Next.js applications. The backend is hosted on **Render**, a modern cloud platform for hosting backend services.
